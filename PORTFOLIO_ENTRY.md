# Portfolio Entry: myFlix Client Application

## 1. Project Description

The myFlix Client is a modern React-based single-page application that provides users with a comprehensive movie browsing experience. Built as the frontend for a movie database API, this application demonstrates proficiency in React development, responsive design, and modern web application architecture.

**Key Features:**
- User authentication and registration system
- Movie browsing with advanced filtering capabilities
- Detailed movie information views
- Personal favorites management
- Responsive design optimized for all devices
- Real-time search functionality

**My Role**: Frontend Developer responsible for complete client-side application development

**Tasks Completed:**
- Designed and implemented React component architecture
- Built user authentication system with form validation
- Created responsive UI using React Bootstrap and custom SCSS
- Integrated with REST API for data management
- Implemented advanced filtering and search functionality
- Developed favorites management system
- Deployed application to Netlify with CI/CD pipeline

**Key Decisions:**
- Chose React functional components with hooks for modern development patterns
- Selected React Bootstrap for rapid, responsive UI development
- Implemented client-side routing for seamless single-page application experience
- Used React's built-in state management instead of Redux for appropriate project scope

**Lessons Learned:**
- Advanced React hooks usage and component lifecycle management
- Professional API integration patterns and error handling
- Mobile-first responsive design principles
- Modern development workflow with Git branching and deployment
